Write a program to classify a triangle as Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene based on its side lengths


a = float(input("Enter length of first side: "))
b = float(input("Enter length of second side: "))
c = float(input("Enter length of third side: "))

if (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a):
    # Classify the triangle
    if a == b == c:
        print("The triangle is Equilateral.")
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        print("The triangle is Isosceles.")
    else:
        print("The triangle is Scalene.")
else:
    print("The given sides do not form a valid triangle.")
